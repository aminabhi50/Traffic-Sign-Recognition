# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
 Traffic sign recognition is one of the most popular topics of computer vision and deep learning in recent years. I choose this topic for my Research Methodology subject. The deep learning based method, custom convolutional neural network used for traffic sign recognition, which classifies and recognizes 43 different traffic signs.
